title: "Surveying the Rust Verification Landscape"
collection: publications
category: workshops
excerpt: 'We explore what it means to do Rust verification. Specifically, we explore which properties are worth verifying for Rust; what techniques exist to verify them; and which code is worth verifying. In doing so, we motivate an effort to verify safety properties of the Rust standard library, presenting the relevant challenges along with ideas to address them.'
