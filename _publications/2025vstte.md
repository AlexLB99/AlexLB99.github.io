permalink: /publication/2025-VSTTE
excerpt: 'In this paper, we discuss the lessons learned thus far from this verification effort, from both our work on it, as well as that of the broader community. In particular, we start by reviewing what has been accomplished thus far, as well as the main tools used (specifically, their advantages and their limitations). We then focus on some of the remaining fundamental obstacles to verifying the standard library, and propose potential solutions to overcome them.'
