I am an ECE PhD student at the Univeristy of Waterloo, supervised by professor [Patrick Lam](https://patricklam.ca). Before this, I completed my master's degree at Concordia University in information systems security (supervised by professor [Ivan Pustogarov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PHfZcJMAAAAJ&hl=en)). My interests are primarily in automated program analysis -- previously I'd been more focused on dynamic analysis, but I've since shifted more towards static analysis. More specifically, my current research is all about formally verifying the Rust standard library.
