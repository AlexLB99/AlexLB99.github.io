I am a first-year ECE PhD student at the Univeristy of Waterloo, supervised by professor Patrick Lam. Before this, I completed my master's degree at Concordia University in information systems security, supverised by professor Ivan Pustogarov. My interests are primarily in automated program analysis. Previously I'd been more focused on dynamic analysis, but I've since shifted more towards static analysis. More specifically, my current research is all about verifying the Rust standard library.
